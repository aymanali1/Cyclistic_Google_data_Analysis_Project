# Cyclistic
### A Google Data Analytics Certificate Project
In this Project, I'm using the Cyclistic's historical trip datasets provided by google to analyze and identify trends.
The project uses the previous 12 months period of Cyclistic trip data: 
from: 2024 April 
to: 2025 March 
named as 202404-divvy-tripdata.zip to 202503-divvy-tripdata.zip
The datasets were downloaded and combined in one dataframe using Python 3.12.3 and Jupyter notebook.

You can find the datasets at:

#### Note:
A .sql file was provided to demonstrate how the data can be combined easily in one table in the normal data bases based work-frames possibly preferred by some companies.
